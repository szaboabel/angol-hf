        <h1 id="cim">Breaking Bad</h1>
        <p id="p1">Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set
            and
            filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
            overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of
            stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman
            (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he
            dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld.</p>

        <h2>The science in Breaking Bad</h2>
        <p>It's not inaccurate, just vague. They never really give you any of the important details, like how he goes
            about resolving the enantiomers. Also, the chemicals they use would be impractical for most DIY meth cooks,
            as they are difficult to procure. They make a big deal about getting methylamine, but IRL it's not hard at
            all to make. It's the other things needed for reductive amination that are hard to come by.</p>
            
        <h2>The message of Breaking Bad</h2>
        <p>There are lots of messages in Breaking Bad. One that I find very touching is that no matter how independent
            you feel your actions are, they affect others in ways you can't imagine. No matter your intentions, you can
            and will (if you go to Walter’s extremes) hurt others irreparably. And while Walter likes to think he’s in
            control, he's not, simply because others have their own free will.</p>

        <h2>In conclusion</h2>
        <p>Dull moments are hard to come by. Then there are tons of twists and cliffhangers that are perfectly timed so
            as to keep the audience wanting
            more. With a show this big, and an audience this vast, there was a lot of pressure on the writers to make an
            incredible series finale. They managed to pull it off, and more. The series finale was so great because it
            was unexpected yet still made sense.</p>
